Dragon Dining (DD) at Yokohama International School (YIS), will deliver a farm to fork experience from August 2016

Students, staff and the YIS community will have a wealth of healthier choices, removing any processed foods from the menu with a large focus on organic where possible, locally sourced fair trade and farm to fork dining.

DD will provide a greater choice of non- meat items to reduce our carbon footprint, and enjoy a more heathy and sustainable lifestyle.

The catering at YIS will deliver a living breathing dynamic food service, available all day. Serving energy boosting breakfasts, nutritious stimulating lunches and creative afternoon snack items. Using our experience and listening to the community, will ensure we deliver a service that is tailor-made for YIS and the envy of all International schools.
