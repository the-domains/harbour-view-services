Menus at YIS have a large focus on offering alternative foods to meat based choices. Choices include no-meat gratins, salads and quiches, vegan curries, a huge range of pulses and beans along with daily soup, that use only vegan ingredients.

The salad bar includes daily protein rich foods of grains, beans, and pulses, along with plenty of colorful market fresh meat free items.

Fish in any diet especially those of young minds is an important factor, due to the essential oils, vitamins and minerals contained. A fish element is creatively presented weekly to encourage more students to give it a go and swap from meat.

Providing great lunches will inspire students to make healthy options. With the help of a thoughtful and holistic approach through teaching, research, and hands on experience, we will have a student, that makes the right food choices, as a matter of routine.
