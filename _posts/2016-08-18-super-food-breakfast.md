We at Dragon Dining understand that a well nourished students perform better than poorly nourished, and that optimal cognitive functions of the body require many essential vitamins, minerals, fats and proteins. Students who are "food-insufficient" are generally lower performers of scores in many academic subjects, most often occurring because of a shorten attention span.

Dragon Dining will produce special superfood breakfasts that will be available to all students participating in tests on applicable days. Ingredients used will boost cognitive skills such as blueberries, cereals, wholegrain bread, seeds and even sage for the adventurous.
